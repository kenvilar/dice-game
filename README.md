# dice-game
A dice game using pure JavaScript

## Rules
* 2 players needed
* A player rolls a dice in each turn as many times as he/she whishes. Each result gets added to his/her current score
* If the player rolls a 1, all his/her roll/s will get lost and no results will be added to his current score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can select to 'Hold', which means that his/her current score gets added to his/her main score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* Any player who will reach 100 points on main score wins the game!

# GOOD LUCK! :)
